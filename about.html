    <dt>Hybrid structure</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
    The <b>hybrid structure</b> selected for this visualization is
    <b>Interactive slide show</b> with the following narrated slides:
	    
	    <li>  1. Anaimated Map </li>
	    <li>  2. Overview Map  </li>
	    <li>  3. Top Three Countries _Multiple-line chart </li>
	    <li>  4. Effect Map </li>
	    

    Interaction is incorporated within each slide, as described in the triggers section below.
    This structure allows the user to further explore particular points of
    the presentation before moving ahead to the next slide.
    The interactive slideshow balances the author-driven (explanatory)
    and the user-driven (exploratory) approaches.
    Each individual slide communicates the author's message then
    prompts the user to interact with the display.
    This structure allowed me to walk the user through data-dimensions
    and step-by-step.
    The navigation bar at the top of the visualization ensures that
    the user only moves forward in the presentation when it is ready to do so,
    allows the user to go back to slides if desired,
    and clearly shows the presentation contents and location within the presentation.

    <dt>Scenes</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
      Layout and design of the <b><u>scenes</u></b> - Each scene is represented
      by one chart on one slide. The presentation starts with overall view of
      the data on the animated map, to demonstrate the earthquakes events that happend
      around the world from 2018 to present(2019.7). It then continues with
      more detail that focuse on the magnitide of earthquake, and the user can select country and year.
      The user can look at details on demand (tooltip). Top three countries slide
      that shows the top amount of earthquake countries in this period. The last slide focus on
      the earthquake damage map, the user can see more details of effect map by selecting country, damages type and year.The scenes are structured to go from high level to detailed,
      The design is consistent in terms of style (font, colors, and layout).
      All slides have the same navigation bar at the top to keep the user
      oriented, so the current location in the presentation is clearly marked
      using the same color scheme.

    <dt>Annotations</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
      Application of the <b><u>annotations</u></b> - Text annotations explain
      the data presented on the screen. The visualization highlights specific
      data items or trends – color density and circles area on the maps
      highlight the locations o=in the world where terrorist attacks are most
      common. Circle color scale in conjunction with time scale demonstrate
      the growth trend over time. The animated map is using the enter() and
      transition() template to add the data points to the screen with 0 opacity
      (transparent), then transition them into visible opacity one at a time
      to create the animation. All tooltips are displayed on mouseover(),
      mousemove() and removed on mouseout() to show data on-demand. All
      elements follow a template for visual consistency.
      </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Parameters</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
    The <b><u>parameters</u></b> - Data variables are converted into color,
    shape, size, location, and time using functions and scales to form the
    visualizations. On the maps, projection functions are used to convert
    latitude and longitude data into 2D map coordinates. The mouse position
    on the screen is tracked to form the interactive user experience, and
    place the tooltip for the object pointed to. The animated map has a time
    parameter that controls the pacing and appearance of data points on the screen.
    </p>
  </dd>

    <dt>Triggers</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
    The <b><u>triggers</u></b> and User Interface events - On the animated map,
    when the user clicks the “watch again” button, it triggers a screen refresh,
    and the animation restarts.
    A timer parameter is used to pace the data points appearance on the screen.
    The button is clearly visible on the screen.
    On the other slides, the user can hover over the circles to see a tooltip
    with additional information. The mouse position on the screen corresponds
    to the circle and the data related to it is being displayed.
    The text annotation on top of each slide prompts the user to try it.
    The navigation bar at the bottom of the screen highlights the current page
    in crimson, attracting attention, and the other items on the bar hint there
    are additional pages hidden. Once the user hovers over the additional items,
    the mouse changes shape as well to prompt a click to reveal them.
